# CaseLink
An AI Powered Investigative Intelligence

This project focuses on developing an AI-driven system that integrates video evidence analysis with legal knowledge retrieval to support law enforcement investigations and legal proceedings.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Automated Video Transcription**: The system transcribes both audio and visual elements in video files. This includes converting speech to text and extracting text from visual cues such as license plates and signboards.
- **A Content Analysis for Key Events**: The system analyzes video content to identify suspicious activities and anomalies like unusual movements or potentially illegal actions. This reduces the manual workload and highlights key moments for investigators.
- **Case File Generation**: Extracted information is used to compile detailed case files. Each file includes suspect activities, relevant observations, and timestamped events, providing investigators with a structured summary.
- **Legal Query System (Agentic RAG)**: Answers context-aware legal questions by linking evidence to Indian and U.S. legal statutes.
- **Intelligent Legal Reasoning**: Uses agent-based retrieval to interpret complex scenarios and recommend applicable legal actions.
